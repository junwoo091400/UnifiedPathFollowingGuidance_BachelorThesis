	abstract = {Small, low-speed fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating autonomously, beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) will inevitably encounter winds rising to levels near or exceeding the vehicles' nominal airspeed. In this paper, we develop a nonlinear lateral-directional path following guidance law with explicit consideration of online wind estimates. Energy efficient airspeed reference compensation logic is developed for excess wind scenarios (i.e. when the wind speed rises above the airspeed), enabling either mitigation, prevention, or over-powering of excess wind induced run-away from a given path. The developed guidance law is demonstrated on a representative small, low-speed test UAV in two flight experiments conducted in mountainous regions of Switzerland with strong, turbulent wind conditions, gusts reaching up to 13 meters per second. We demonstrate track-keeping errors of less than 1 meter consistently maintained during a representative duration of gusting, excess winds and a mean ground speed undershoot of 0.5 meters per second from the commanded minimum forward ground speed demonstrated in over 5 minutes of the showcased flight results.},

Applications such as mapping, search and rescue, patrol, and surveillance require the UAV to autonomously follow a predefined path at a prescribed height. The most commonly used paths are straight lines and circular orbits. Path-following algorithms ensure that the UAV will follow a predefined path in three or two dimensions at constant height. A basic requirement for these path-following algorithms is that they must be accurate and robust to wind disturbances.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional nonlinear guidance law for path-following is proposed using differential geometry of space curves. The proposed guidance law makes a vehicle converge to and then follow a given desired path of general shape, which does not require strict restrictions on initial position and velocity. To take the advantages of the look-ahead effect for precise and robust path-following, the proposed guidance law takes the form of pure pursuit guidance, which is designed to align the velocity of the vehicle with the look-ahead vector. The look-ahead angle and the radially shifted distance are designed using differential geometry of the desired path. The proposed guidance law generates the normal acceleration command required for exact path-following and finally overcomes the limitations of previously developed look-ahead point-based methods in the case of general three-dimensional path-following. Stability analysis on the guidance law to follow constant-curvature planar paths is performed. The performance of the proposed guidance law is demonstrated by numerical simulations for various types of desired paths.},

	abstract = {Hybrid quad-plane unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which combine the advantages of multicopters and fixed-wing UAVs, are gaining increasing attention. However, quad-planes are characterized by complex structures, high nonlinearity, strong coupling, and three flight regimes (hover, transition, and fixed-wing flight), which bring great challenges to the research of their control laws. This article aims to design control laws for a quad-plane in fixed-wing and hover flight regimes based on a robust nonlinear control method, incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI), so that the quad-plane can follow a given path autonomously. Firstly, a mathematical model of the quad-plane is established on the basis of kinematics and dynamics. Subsequently, cascade control structures are proposed and divided into inner and outer loops. A control law is designed for each control loop based on INDI. To improve the performance of the designed control law, reference models are added to the inner loops to shape the input commands and provide feedforward inputs. Finally, simulation results corroborate the performance and robustness of the proposed control law. Compared with the control law designed by active disturbance rejection control and proportional-integral-derivative control methods, the INDI-based control law is more robust.},

	abstract = {In recent years, small, easily manageable, operated, and maintained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become ubiquitous in an every-growing set of industrial, humanitarian, scientific, and commercial domains. For large-scale remote sensing and mapping applications, small fixed-wing platforms provide the advantages of longer range and higher speeds, with respect to their Micro-Aerial Vehicle (MAV) counterparts. However, today’s fixed-wing UAVs are largely limited to a primitive set of basic waypoint following and pre-programmed tasks, with little awareness of the environment in which they fly, adaptability to changing conditions, or higher-level decision making capabilities. Particularly relevant to small fixed-wing mission profiles, is the required ability to operate safely near uncertain terrain while disturbed by possibly strong and turbulent wind fields. Enabling these activities entails the design of efficient, robust, and more adaptable motion planning and control algorithms which moreover adhere to the vehicle’s restrictive dynamic flight envelope. The primary goal of this thesis is to develop practical control and local re-planning strategies for low-flying, small, fixed-wing UAVs with explicit awareness of these environmental hazards. Part A of this thesis addresses the challenge of guiding small, low-speed fixed-wing aircraft in strong winds. Our first contribution in this part is the unique consideration of excess winds, i.e. wind speeds that exceed the vehicle’s nominal airspeed, within a lateral-directional control law for fixed-wing UAVs. We develop a principled, nonlinear guidance law which guarantees convergence to a safe and stable vehicle configuration with respect to the wind field while preserving some tracking performance with respect to the path target. We then expand on this concept by including an energy efficient airspeed reference compensation logic, enabling not only mitigation, but also prevention or over-powering of excess winds which would otherwise cause the aircraft to "run-away". We emphasize heavily in this second iteration on field testing results, demonstrating track keeping errors of less than 1 meter consistently maintained during gusting excess winds over various mountainous regions in Switzerland. The third component of this part revisits the efficiency of the airspeed references. A coupled approach to airspeed and heading reference commands is developed with a more principled consideration of airspeed reference minimization. The coupled method is compared against the previous decoupled approach in simulations showing both increased power-efficiency and tracking performance in static and dynamic winds. Part B of this thesis operates as a road map to fast, environment-aware local re-planning for fixed-wing UAVs operating near terrain. We first delve into the practicalities of deploying a guidance level Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) on a small fixed-wing platform. We develop new control augment modeling methods featuring reduced order models of the underlying low-level autopilot response and quasi-steady forces, simple parameter identification procedures, and open loop predictability on the order of tens of seconds, making our modeling approach suitable for long horizon NMPC. Through flight experiments, we demonstrate Dubins aircraft path segment tracking in three dimensions with wind speeds exceeding 50\% of the vehicle’s airspeed, and further show a mock motor failure scenario. A particular focus is further spent on soft constraint formulation. The third component of this part reworks the developments of the first two towards our local re-planning formulation. Wind-aware reference trajectory generation is developed from the guidance logic in Part A for lateral-directional states, and vertical wind is included in the longitudinal guidance. Vision-based elevation mapping is utilized to to provide a generalized 2.5D world representation to the aircraft. The map is bilinearly interpolated for height feedback, and we design an efficient ray casting approach for detection of forward (line of flight) and lateral occlusions. The occlusions are used to construct novel "relative" Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (RESDFs), which are a function of the relative velocity between the vehicle and obstacle. We further present a method of transforming the RESDFs into optimizable soft constraints for the objective function of the NMPC. A preliminary example of the full system acting to avoid an obstructing hillside is demonstrated in hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation.},
