With the advancement of low-cost electronics and UAV components, an interesting hybrid vehicle type so-called 'Hybrid VTOL' has been under the spotlight of academia and researchers' interest recently. Due to its versatility of utilizing both modes of operation from two distinct vehicle regimes: Multirotor and Fixed Wing, this breed of vehicle can fly further in an energy-efficient manner, meanwhile preserving the capability to launch and land in a small confined space when needed.

However, Hybrid VTOLs usually have a decoupled Path Following a control strategy depending on its mode of operation. Although this approach works in a practical sense, both of the control strategies fail to capture the overall flexibility of the system.

In this thesis, a new Vector Field based Path Following formulation is derived and shown for supporting both fixed-wing and multirotor modes of operation.
