I would like to express my upmost gratitude for everyone who helped me throughout the journey of making this Bachelor Thesis project possible. As Thomas wrote in his PhD dissertation\cite{stastny_low-altitude_2020}, ASL is truly like nowhere else, and has been, and will be a big part of my source of motivation in Robotics.\\

When I came across ASL's AtlantikSolar project in 2016 during my first year in Highschool, I was truly fascinated by the dedication and expertise ASL had to make such an incredible project possible. And undoubtedly, that led me to the field of Robotics, so having done this 4 Months long research at the foundation where my whole journey started was a mesmerizing experience. I will be missing the Coffee Kiosk at ASL, and hope to return in the near future!\\

Also, thank you Auterion for an incredible internship opportunity, and for helping me throughout the duration of the project!
